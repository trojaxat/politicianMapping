# UrlScraper

Currently this is built as a url scraper to take individual attributes of html parts of websites to save them as models that have been pregenerated

The backend is located at [currently on db.json working via AxiosPromise to local file](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-json-db).

Currently everything runs through the index file in the main folder, more information on how to use the UrlParser etc are all included as comments in the class files

## Development

git clone
npm install
npm start
```
